/**
 * This is the Game of Life. Each cell has a state: alive (#) or dead (.). 
 * The number of alive cells is randomly selected at the start of the game.
 * The state of the cells changes each generation. If an alive cell has 2 
 * or 3 alive cells next to it, it stays alive. If it has 1, 0, or 4 or more 
 * cells next to it, it will die. A dead cell comes alive when there are 3 alive
 * cells next to it.
